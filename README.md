# Discord Nitro Stock Bot

As most of you know managing gift links can be hard and somewhat confusing. I made this bot to help with the rotation of stock which applies the FIFO strategy. Here's how to get started

## Requirements

               Make sure you have latest version of node installed and ready to go.

## Installation

```
npm install | npm install discord.js fs (if you encounter any problems) 
```

## Getting Started

I have left you with a simple yet easy to understand structure. To start the bot you will need to open config.json and place your token and desired prefix. Once saved its as easy as typing
```
node .
```
And you should be fine from there.

## Mini Tutorial

- To add stock to bot you type the command (prefix)addstock <type> <nitro codes>
- To send a code type (prefix)nitro <@user> <type> <amount>
- To check the stock simply type (prefix)help

Relating to types you will have the option of 4 types.
- classicmonthly
- classicyearly
- boostmonthly
- boostyearly

`Ensure you copy spelling as it will not add to db if spelt wrong.`
